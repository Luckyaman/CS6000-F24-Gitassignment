\section*{About Me}
Hello! My name is Neeta, and I am an international student, currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at UCCS. With a few years of experience as a software engineer, I am working on various projects aligned with my research interests.

\section*{Current Projects}
I am currently exploring large language models (LLMs) in bioinformatics and conducting a survey related to this topic.

\section*{Research Repository}
I am working with the following Git repository for my research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GitHub Link: \url{https://github.com/ncbi/GeneGPT}
\end{itemize}

I have cloned this repository to my local machine and am actively working on it. 
I have obtained initial results from my first run and am now analyzing them.

\section*{Test Outputs}
Below is a screenshot of the output after setting up the environment and running GeneGPT on GeneTuring using the command:

python main.py 111111

Here, `111111` specifies that all Documentations (Dc.1-2) and Demonstrations (Dm.1-4) are used.

Below is the screenshot from my first run:

\section*{Experience}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I have started working on the project with the goal of achieving meaningful results that will inform my next steps. However, there are moments when I feel stuck, which makes me realize the need to delve deeper into the material.
    
    \item The training process is time-consuming, and I am working on optimizing the workflow to reduce the time required for execution.
\end{enumerate}
